<p>Cambridge (Cambridge) / Composition (Multiple Applications) / Kernel (Kernel) / Embedding (Embedded) / System (System) (CAmkES) is a component-based development platform for building embedded systems. It was developed by researchers at the University of New South Wales, NICTA (National ICT Australia), and the University of Cambridge.</p><p><br></p><p>CAmkES is designed to help developers build complex embedded systems that require high levels of safety, security, and reliability. It is based on the idea of composing individual components together to form a complete system. Each component is a self-contained module that performs a specific function, and can be developed and tested independently of the rest of the system. The components are then integrated into a larger system using a set of formal composition rules.</p><p><br></p><p>CAmkES provides a number of benefits for embedded systems development, including increased modularity, better separation of concerns, improved maintainability, and the ability to reuse components across different projects. It also provides a high degree of assurance, since the formal composition rules ensure that the resulting system is correct by construction.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, CAmkES is a powerful tool for building complex embedded systems that require high levels of safety, security, and reliability.</p>
