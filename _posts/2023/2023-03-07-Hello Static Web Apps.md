<p><strong class="ql-size-large" style="color: rgb(0, 138, 0);">Static web apps</strong> are web applications that <u>do not require server-side processing</u>. <strong>They are built using static files, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, which are served directly to the client browser without the need for a server-side process. </strong>This means that static web apps do not have a backend, and all of the code and content is contained in the client-side files.</p><p>Static web apps are ideal for simple websites, blogs, portfolios, and other web applications that do not require complex server-side processing or database integration. They are easy to deploy and scale, and are generally less expensive to host than traditional web applications.</p><p><br></p><p>Some examples of static web app frameworks include <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 153, 0);">Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, and Next.js.</span> These frameworks provide templates and tools for building static web apps quickly and easily, without the need for a deep understanding of server-side programming or web development.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Static web apps</strong> can be hosted on a variety of platforms, including <u style="color: rgb(178, 178, 0);">GitHub Pages, Netlify, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage.</u><span style="color: rgb(178, 178, 0);"> </span>These platforms offer easy deployment and hosting options for static web apps, and many also include features like CDN integration, SSL certificates, and custom domains.</p>
