<p><strong>Medium Editor</strong> and<strong> TinyMCE</strong> are both popular WYSIWYG editors that can be used in a Jekyll site. Here are some key differences between the two:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>User Interface: The user interface of Medium Editor is minimalistic and straightforward. It has a simple toolbar that contains only the essential formatting options, making it easier to use for beginners. On the other hand, TinyMCE has a more complex UI with a wide range of formatting options, making it more suitable for advanced users.</li><li>Customization: Both editors can be customized to match the design of your Jekyll site. However, TinyMCE offers more customization options, including the ability to create custom buttons and styles.</li><li>File Size: TinyMCE has a larger file size compared to Medium Editor. This can impact page load times, especially on slower internet connections.</li><li>Plugins: Both editors have a wide range of plugins available to extend their functionality. However, TinyMCE has a larger community of developers creating plugins, so there are more options available.</li><li>Compatibility: Both editors are compatible with modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. However, TinyMCE also supports Internet Explorer 11, which is still used by some users.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>In summary, Medium Editor is a good choice if you prefer a minimalistic interface and want to keep the file size of your website small. TinyMCE is a better option if you need advanced customization options and support for Internet Explorer 11.</p>
