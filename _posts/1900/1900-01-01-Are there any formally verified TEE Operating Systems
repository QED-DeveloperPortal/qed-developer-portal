<p>Yes, there are several formally verified TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) operating systems that have been developed and are available for use. Here are a few examples:</p><ol><li>seL4: seL4 is a formally verified microkernel that has been used in TEEs for several applications. It has been formally verified using machine-checked proofs that provide a high degree of confidence in its correctness and security properties.</li><li>Fiasco.OC: Fiasco.OC is another formally verified microkernel that has been used in TEEs. It is designed to be highly configurable and can be customized for different use cases.</li><li>Hafnium: Hafnium is a TEE hypervisor that has been formally verified for functional correctness. It is designed to provide secure isolation between different guest operating systems and can be used to build secure systems that run multiple operating systems.</li><li>Keystone: Keystone is a TEE operating system that has been developed using formal methods. It is designed to provide strong isolation between different applications and has been used in several research projects.</li></ol><p>It's worth noting that while formally verified TEE operating systems can provide a high degree of assurance in their correctness and security properties, they are not foolproof and can still be vulnerable to other types of attacks such as side-channel attacks or hardware-based attacks. Therefore, it's important to use a combination of security measures to protect TEEs, including hardware and software countermeasures, physical security measures, and regular monitoring and updating of the system.</p>
