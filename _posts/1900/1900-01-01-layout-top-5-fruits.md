A few months ago someone brought this topic up at a local establishment: what are your top 5 fruits of all time? An interesting question. Everyone put forward an argument for their favourites. There were a few left field choices and a lot of crossover.

There are many opinions on the topic but don't listen to the others or Chat GPT - listen to me.

The following are my top five fruits with the following caveats:

 - The fruit are listed in no particular order of rank, other than the fact each of these make the top 5.
- We are talking the best possible version of each fruit - for peaches think firm yet sweet and juicy! No floury apples in the list (or apples for that matter - this is the top 5!)

## Lychee

What a fruit. Fantastic memories of heading up to Far North Queensland for Christmas and Dad picking us up from the airport with a fresh bag of lychees in the back, condensation already forming on the inside of the bag as the lychees were so plump and juicy. The texture and the sweetness - easily cracks the top 5.

## Mango

Staying on the tropical theme with another Summertime winner. Mangoes are so incredibly good. The taste of Summer.

## Peach

A top peach is almost second to nothing - plump, firm flesh bursting with juicyness and sweetness. Another easy top 5.

## Blueberry

This makes my provisional top 5 - I love eating handfuls straight from the punnett. Such an awesome flavour.

## Pomegranite

BOOM. Dad introduced me to these bad boys some time ago. Yes it takes time to carefully remove the pulpy seeds but when you do it is worth it. Slightly tart with the juice and that nutty kernal - I adore them.
