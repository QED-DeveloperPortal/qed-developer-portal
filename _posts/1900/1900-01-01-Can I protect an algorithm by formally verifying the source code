<p>Formal verification of source code can provide a level of assurance that an algorithm has been implemented correctly, but it is not a foolproof method for protecting an algorithm.</p><p>Formal verification is a process of using mathematical methods to prove that a program meets its specification, and it can help to catch certain types of errors before they cause problems. However, formal verification is not a comprehensive security solution on its own.</p><p>Even if the source code is formally verified, it may still be vulnerable to attacks such as reverse engineering, which could allow an attacker to discover and copy the algorithm. Additionally, there may be other ways to reverse-engineer or infer the algorithm's behavior without having access to the source code, such as by observing its inputs and outputs.</p><p>Therefore, if you want to protect an algorithm, formal verification should be just one part of a larger security strategy. Other techniques that may be used in combination with formal verification include code obfuscation, encryption, and limiting access to the algorithm through legal means like patents or licenses.</p>
