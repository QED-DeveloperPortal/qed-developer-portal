<p>FIPS 140-2 (Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 140-2) is a U.S. government standard that specifies security requirements for cryptographic modules used in protecting sensitive information. FIPS 140-2 Level 4 is the highest level of security that can be achieved under this standard.</p><p>FIPS 140-2 Level 4 requires that a cryptographic module meets all of the requirements of Level 3 and also provides an added level of security against physical tampering, such as attempts to bypass the tamper-evident mechanisms.</p><p>Specifically, to achieve FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certification, a cryptographic module must meet the following requirements:</p><ol><li>The module must provide physical or logical separation between the cryptographic module and any other modules or systems.</li><li>The module must include active protection mechanisms, such as sensors and alarms, to detect and respond to attempts to physically access the module.</li><li>The module must be designed to withstand a range of physical attacks, such as environmental attacks, electromagnetic radiation, and power analysis attacks.</li><li>The module must meet additional requirements for key management, cryptographic algorithms, and other security features.</li></ol><p>FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certification is often required for cryptographic modules used in high-security applications, such as defense, aerospace, or critical infrastructure. Achieving FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certification provides the highest level of assurance that a cryptographic module has been designed and tested to meet rigorous security standards and can provide strong protection against physical attacks.</p>
