            The Developer Portal is a website that provides documentation, resources, and tools for developers to learn, use, and integrate with an organization's APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It is a centralized platform that offers developers everything they need to work with an organization's APIs, including code samples, tutorials, SDKs (Software Development Kits), API reference documentation, testing tools, and community forums.

It streamlines the process of integrating with an API, reduces the time to market, and increases developer satisfaction. It is also a platform that provides a clear and structured way for the organization to communicate with developers, gather feedback, and manage the API lifecycle.
